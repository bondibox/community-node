# The TRON Community Node Project


On June 25th, 2018, Tron Labs launched the Tron main net, a DPoS blockchain.

A decentralized blockchain outsources the operation of its network to delegated nodes called Super Representatives, often called block producers.

Tron pays these nodes 32 TRX coins for every block of data produced. The 27 nodes will take turns creating these blocks at the rate of 1 block every 3 seconds.

The Community Node organization is registered as a candidate to become a Tron Super Representative.
